## Summary:
This study focuses on optimizing the production of monodisperse GG-based microparticles (GG:Alg) using the coaxial air flow method. The research employs a statistical approach to understand how various factors influence particle size and dispersibility.

### Key Findings:

1. **Optimization Process**:
   - A direct relationship was identified between air flow, pump flow, and particle diameter.
   - Air flow and solution viscosity significantly affect particle diameter and dispersibility.

2. **Particle Size Reduction**:
   - Drying the particles reduced their size to a range of 400-150 µm.

3. **pH Sensitivity**:
   - The particles exhibit different behaviors at pH 6.5 and 7.4 due to changes in anionic moieties within GG and Alg.
   - At neutral pH, particles swelled more and showed higher drug encapsulation efficiencies compared to acidic pH.

4. **Drug Release Profiles**:
   - Modified KP (Korsmeyer-Peppas) and PS models indicated Fickian release profiles for the microparticles.

### Implications:

- The study demonstrates that GG:Alg microparticles can be effectively produced with controlled size and dispersibility using the coaxial air flow method.
- These particles show potential as a drug delivery system (DDS), particularly in environments with neutral pH, where they exhibit better swelling and encapsulation properties.
- Future research could explore their application in more complex systems, such as injectable DDS, with various drugs.

### Future Directions:

- Investigate the use of GG:Alg microparticles in complex drug delivery scenarios.
- Evaluate their potential as injectable DDS for different therapeutic agents.
